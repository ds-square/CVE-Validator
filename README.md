# CVE-Validator
Repository for IEEE CSR 23 Submission

## Launching the service
- Navigate to /backend
- Run the command: flask --app cpe_scores run --port 10101

## Supported routes
- GET  http://127.0.0.1:10101/
Returns a copy of this readme in html format

- GET  http://127.0.0.1:10101/snapshot/
Returns a list of all snaphsot currently loaded on the system, in json format

- GET  http://127.0.0.1:10101/snapshot/<snapshot_id>
Returns a list of all hosts present in the snapshot, in json format

- GET  http://127.0.0.1:10101/host/<snapshot_id>/<host_id>
Returns a list of all platforms and CVE of the (snapshot, host) tuple, along with their scores and validation status. Uses json format

- GET  http://127.0.0.1:10101/platform/<snapshot_id>/<host_id>/<platform_id>
Returns validation status and scoring of a (snapshot, host, platform) touple, in json format

- PUT  http://127.0.0.1:10101/platform/<snapshot_id>/<host_id>/<platform_id>
Sets validation status of a (snapshot, host, platform) touple.
Uses payload {"validated": "confirmed"} in the Body.
Accepted values for "validated" are: "unknown", "confirmed" and "discarded".
Has same return of the GET at this same route.

## Quickstart guide
The first task is to run the server using flask and python 3.

Once the server is up, use a client, such as [postman](https://www.postman.com/), to send http requests.

In particular, use GET http://127.0.0.1:10101/snapshot/ to get a list of all available snapshot_id

Then, use GET http://127.0.0.1:10101/snapshot/<snapshot_id> to get a list of all available host_id

Lastly, use GET http://127.0.0.1:10101/platform/<snapshot_id>/<host_id>/<platform_id> as the main function to inspect the validator's internal status for the chosen host, such as platforms, their scores according to multiple scoring criteria (In our paper we referred to what the application exposes as the "sum" score, but we are also experimenting with other scoring strategies), their validation status (unknown, confirmed, discarded) as well as vulnerabilities and their validation status (unknown, confirmed, discarded).

Once you have selected a platform_id to confirm or discard, use PUT http://127.0.0.1:10101/platform/<snapshot_id>/<host_id>/<platform_id> with payload {"validated": "confirmed"} or {"validated": "discarded"} in the Body to confirm or discard the platform from the host

The validator will now recalculate all the scores and vulnerability validation statuses, which will needed to be fetched again using the GET http://127.0.0.1:10101/platform/<snapshot_id>/<host_id>/<platform_id>

And thus, the cycle continues at the operator's will.
